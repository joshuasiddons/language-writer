- set up the project with vite (to set up reactjs frontend)
- i'm using express for the backend, which makes api calls easier
- also using axios in the front-end, which allows for making api calls to server
- had problems with versions / dependencies - npm showing security flaws, but these were for eslint, which won't reach production, so they won't affect the security of the final application
- i resolved this by choosing to leave these vulnerabilities so i could still use axios
- followed this tutorial to set up the project (but will be departing from this soon)

- had some trouble setting up calls to back end - was using proxy in vite settings wrong
    - did manually without proxy, using full url, and it worked fine !

- removed the vast majority of boilerplate code so I could really learn how the app is working
    - i think i will start from scratch without vite for my next project

- been using gemini to research stacks, find out what the file structure is all about, etc.
    - not been using it for code generation since i want to learn!
        - this is one bit that i will need to work on after this project, since I have used a generator (vite) to set most of it up

- early on i did some debugging with nvm (node verison manager) to change which version of node is being used (ended up with just the latest lts)

- Working on app again - been restructuring to a more standard react project structure - done a lot of research for this
- Researched how to add scripts in jsx, by using react properties like onClick, allowing me to focus the text box by clicking anywhere on the page
    - Also learnt how to use this to automatically resize the text box as the user inputs more lines
- The main text entry field is now complete. I am going to add some stats that will appear in the bottom corner
- Learnt to use react useState hook to share data between components (a textarea and a stats box for it)
- currently trying to get a line counter to work - this is proving difficult due to having to calculate the size of the box

- Was able to get the line counter working by accessing line height via getComputedStyle - I still need to do more research on what exactly this does

- Returning this project to build on it as a language learning tool. Planning to implement AI to translate inputs, providing explanations for the translations
